# 🚀 Quick Start - Self-Healing Tests

## 🎯 Instant Demo (No Installation Required)

Your Selenium tests broke when you changed `.login-btn` to `.btn-primary`. 
See how our self-healing tests automatically adapt:

```bash
node self-healing-demo.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔍 Looking for login button:
   1. ❌ NOT FOUND: .login-btn
   2. ✅ FOUND: .btn-primary          ← Your new selector found automatically!
   🎉 SUCCESS: Test automatically adapted to your UI change!
```

## 🛠️ Problem Solved

- ❌ **Before**: Selenium test breaks when you change `.login-btn` → `.btn-primary`
- ✅ **After**: Self-healing test automatically finds `.btn-primary` as fallback
